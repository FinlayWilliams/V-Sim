# V-Sim 
## A Virus Spread Simulation Tool for Botnet Propagation in IoT Devices

*COMP3000 Final Year Project*

### About the Application

V-Sim is a tool that simulates the IoT-SIS Virus Model proposed in *Modelling the Spread of Botnet Malware in IoT-Based Wireless Sensor Networks* by Dilara Acarali, Muttukrishnan Rajarajan, Nikos Komninos, and B. B. Zarpel√£o.

It models botnet virus propagation through IoT devices, such as IoT-based wireless sensor nodes.

The goal is to provide users with an in-depth understanding of not only how these models work, but of how IoT devices are impacted by botnets and viruses; what factors make the virus spread wider or lesser.

The application comes with a set of configurations displaying a range of different scenarios - but allows the user to create an many configurations as they desire - alterable in anyway, providing commentary and feedback on the resulting virus spread.

### Application Interfaces:

## Home Screen:
![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/7e4f2f6954523219aaf98c7fa2b9ec3b.png "Application Home Screen")

This is the home screen, the interface reach when launching the application. From here, all saved IoT-SIS Model configurations can be accessed, as well as all of the features of the application.

## Configuration Inspect Screen:

The Configuration Inspection interface allows the exploration of all variables and conditions within the model, contributing towards the result (the virus propagation) of the selected configuration. From here, the configuration scores can be veiwed as well.

## Configuration Control Screen:

This interface is where each configuration can be edited and controlled from. Each starting condition can be altered, with the outcome instantly observed. 

## Configuration Comparison Screen:

Finally, the configuration comparison screen allows the user to select two different configurations and compare them side-by-side in order to quickly view which one has done better, and where.
